### How difficult did you find this (0 - 10)? (0 very easy, 10 very difficult)
8

### How long did it take?
Forever, I did not finish. 

### Was there anything that you struggled with?  If so, what?
The homework seems irrelevant to the class materials. Might not be correct, but this what it looked to me

### Is there anything that you would like some further information on?
Exactly, We need an office hours solely dedicated to "symbols, hashes and weirdo datatypes" in ruby.
Ruby is less verbose and well explained in English language syntax, but still it has some unusual ways of doing things that are different from other verbose languages. 

### Do you have any suggestions to improve this assignment?
I love how the homework is challenging. Sometimes seems undoable. However keeping up with this pace will force us to lookup things, docs in instance, and expand our horizons of thinking.

Yet, some other may feel this is exhausting and make them hate the concept and logic behind programming. 

So it is a double-edged sword. And I'm pretty sure you will use it the right way
